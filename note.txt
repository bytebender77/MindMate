Note: PyTorch is large (~2–3GB) and may take a few minutes on macOS ARM. If you want to avoid it, options:
Use a CPU-only build (smaller but slower)
Make the emotion analyzer optional (use API-based analysis)
Use a lighter emotion analysis library
The current setup uses a local transformers model, which requires PyTorch. If installation is slow or you prefer alternatives, I can adjust the setup.
After installation, run the backend:
python -m app.main
The backend should start on http://localhost:8000.
